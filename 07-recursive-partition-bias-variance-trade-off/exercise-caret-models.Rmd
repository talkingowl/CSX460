## Tuning Parameter

Generically and regardless of model type, what are the purposes of a model
tuning parameters?

The purposes of model tuning parameters is to tune a model by setting parameters so that you can optimize your results and enable your algorithm to perform the "best." For example, in the model k nearest neighbors, you can tune the model by specifying the number of k's in the model that are used.

## Caret Models

This assignment demonstrates the use of caret for constructing models. Each
model should be built and compared using using `Kappa` as the performance
metric calculated using 10-fold repeated cross-validation with 3 folds.

Using the rectangular data that you created for the NYCFlights to create a model
for arr_delay >= 15 minutes.

- glm
- rpart
- knn
- C50
- randomForest
- adaBoost
- Two methods of your choice from the Caret Model List (you will need to install any dependencies)

Save the caret objects with the names provided.

```{r}
#Read the following csv files from data folder from week 2 of class
airports <- read_csv("airports.csv")
flights <- read_csv("flights.csv")
planes <- read_csv("planes.csv")
weather <- read_csv("weather.csv")
#Combine datasets into one data table:
nycflights.all <- left_join(flights, planes, by = "tailnum")
nycflights.all <- left_join(nycflights.all, airports, c("origin" = "faa"))
nycflights.all <- left_join(nycflights.all, airports, c("dest" = "faa"))
nycflights.all <- left_join(nycflights.all, weather, by = c("origin" = "origin", "time_hour" = "time_hour"))

#Create a new column called "delay15min" with two categories: flights with an arrival delay >= 15 min and flights with arrival delay < 15 min
nycflights.all$delay15min <- ifelse(nycflights.all$arr_delay >= 15, 1, 0) 
nycflights.all$delay15min <- as.factor(nycflights.all$delay15min)
#Remove NAs in delay column
nycflights.all <- nycflights.all[complete.cases(nycflights.all$delay15min),]

#Split data into training and testing data sets
set.seed(1000)
inTraining <- createDataPartition(nycflights.all$delay15min, p = .75, list = FALSE)
training <- nycflights.all[ inTraining,]
testing <- nycflights.all[-inTraining,]
training2 <- training[1:1000,]

#Create formula
formula <- delay15min ~ dep_time + sched_dep_time + dep_delay + arr_time + sched_arr_time + arr_delay + flight + air_time + distance + alt.x

#Calculate training or apparent performance of the model. Create a stratified random sample of the data into training and test sets using caret
trctrl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 3)

#1. Build the logistic regression model
#fit.glm <- glm(formula = delay15min ~ month.x + dep_time + dep_delay + arr_time + air_time + distance + temp + humid, family = binomial, data = training)

fit.glm <- train(formula, data = training, method = "glm", trControl = trctrl, metric = 'kappa', preProcess = c("center", "scale"))
fit.glm
#kappa = 1

#2. Build the K Nearest Neighbors model
fit.knn <- train(formula, data = training, method = "knn", trControl = trctrl, preProcess = c("center", "scale"))
fit.knn

#3. Build the rpart model
fit.rpart <- train(formula, data = training2, method = "rpart", trControl = trctrl, preProcess = c("center", "scale"))
fit.rpart

#4. Build the Random Forest model
fit.rf <-  train(formula, data = training2, method = "rf", trControl = trctrl, preProcess = c("center", "scale"), metric = 'kappa')
fit.rf

#5. Build the Stochastic Gradient Boosting model
fit.gbm <- train(formula, data = training2, method = "gbm", trControl = trctrl, metric = 'kappa', verbose=FALSE)
fit.gbm

#6. Build Learning Vector Quantization
fit.lvq <- train(formula, data = training2, method = "lvq", trControl = trctrl, metric = 'kappa')
fit.lvq

```

Compare the  models?

Which is best?  Why?

Run the fit models through a function of manuall kappa calculation and create a table that compares all the values
